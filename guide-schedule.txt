To set the name and time of the Meet click "CHANGE SCHEDULE", it will open an Excel file.

Set the Meet time in the column with the hours.

Set the Meet name in the corrispondent cell (day column, hour row).

If you leave the cells empty nothing will be opened.

This app is made for the students, so the days are form Moday to Friday.

You can't add rows or columns.

That's all!
