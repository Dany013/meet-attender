To set the link of the Meet click "CHANGE LINKS", it will open a JSON file.

Set the name of the Meet (THE SAME YOU USED IN THE EXCEL FILE) before the ":". If the name is not the same as the one in the excel file nothing will open.

Set the link of the Meet after the ":".

EVERYTHING MUST STAY BETWEEN THE CURLY BRACKETS AND THE EVERY END OF THE LINE (EXCEPT THE LAST) MUST HAVE A COMMA.

YOU CAN SET HOW MANY LINKS YOU WANT.

That's all!
